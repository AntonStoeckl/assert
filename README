# Assert

A simple php library which contains assertions and guard methods.
There is usually lots of duplicate code necessary for this kind of code
and php's assert() method is not desired here, because its clumsy to
work with inline. This library is similar to the assert functionality of PHPUnit.

Idea is to reduce the amount of code for implementing assertions
in your model and also reduce/simplify the code paths.

Rule of engagement:

If any of the assertions fails a subclass of `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown.
You can pass next argument to control the message, the message code is encoded in the
assertion itself.

    <?php
    use Assert\Assertion;

    Assertion::integer($value);
    Assertion::boolean($value);
    Assertion::scalar($value);
    Assertion::instanceOf($value, $className);
    Assertion::subclassOf($value, $className);
    Assertion::notEmpty($value);
    Assertion::notNull($value);
    Assertion::regexp($value);
    Assertion::numeric($value);
    Assertion::keyIsset($array, $key);
    Assertion::keyExists($array, $key);
    Assertion::arrayx($array);
